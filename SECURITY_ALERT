Hello,

I am the original author of this library. I monitor forks of the project and view the commits.

Your recent PRs have your private Azure database credentials in a public repo, and I suggest you delete this repo
and keep those files uncommited. For additional measures I'd change your MySQL password as well.

Commits that caught my attention:
 * https://github.com/Promise-Igbo/nba-sql/commit/24a1c423cc3949b1e7d48c73bbb56fa04a9ba3e5
 * https://github.com/Promise-Igbo/nba-sql/commit/bbd6661b9a8a8625c60425fe5a236623e5a3ec1b

Best,
Matt
